    <h1 class="page-heading">About</h1>

      <p> I'm an incoming Computer Science Ph.D. student at Stanford University, rotating with <a href="http://arsenalfc.stanford.edu/kunle"> Kunle Olukotun</a> and <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/chrismre/">Christopher RÃ©</a> in the autumn quarter. My research interests include computer systems, machine learning, and security. I am especially excited by work that lies at the intersection of all three. In May 2017, I graduated from Cornell University with a double major in Electrical & Computer Engineering and Computer Science. At Cornell, I had the opportunity to do research in computer architecture with <a href="http://www.csl.cornell.edu/~cbatten/">Christopher Batten</a>. </p>

    <h1 class="page-heading">Publications</h1>
      <ul>

  <h1 class="page-heading">Projects</h1>
    <ul> 
      <li> <p><b>Proxy Kernel for RISC-V Processor</b>. In Christopher Batten's research group, I built a proxy kernel to extend a RISC-V pipelined processor to support system calls. The proxy kernel proxied the system calls to a manager module via control and status registers. The work was primarily done in <a href="https://github.com/cornell-brg/pymtl">PyMTL</a> (Python-based hardware modeling framework) and C.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p> <b> Neural Network Accelerator</b>. As a final project for ECE 5745 (Complex Digital ASIC Design), I built an accelerator to classify handwritten digits. The design was pushed through the ASIC flow using Synopsys and evaluated on power, performance, and area. </li></p>
    </ul>
